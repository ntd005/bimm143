##PDB statistics

Here we inspect the types of structures in the main database for 3D biomolecular data - the PDB

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” -> “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. 

>Q1. Determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
#read in file
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)

#calculate percentage values for each method
ans <- (stats$Total/sum(stats$Total)) * 100
names(ans) <- rownames(stats)
round(ans, 2)

```


>Q2. Also can you determine what proportion of structures are protein? Aim to have a rendered GitHub document with working code that yields your answers.

```{r}
round(sum(stats$Proteins)/sum(stats$Total) *100 ,2)
```


>Q3  Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
