##Download and clean HIV-Pr receptor structure

Here we will download the 1Hsg PDB structure from the online database, remoce the bound drug from Merk and write out a protein only and ligand only new set of PDB files.

We will use the **bio3d package** functions `get.pdb()`, `read.pdb()` `atom.select()` and finally `write.pdb()`

First we have to load the package with a call to `library(bio3d)`
```{r}
library(bio3d)
#Download PDB file
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb(file.name)
pdb
```

Select protein only
```{r}
prot <- atom.select(pdb,"protein", value=TRUE)
write.pdb(prot, file = "1hsg_protein.pdb")
```

Select and write out a ligand only file
```{r}
lig <- atom.select(pdb, "ligand", value=TRUE)
write.pdb(lig, file = "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```

```{r}
lig
```

```{r}
library(bio3d)
res <- read.pdb("all.pdbqt", multi=TRUE)
write.pdb(res, "results.pdb")
```
